# Database Backup System Documentation

## Overview

The Database Backup System provides automatic and manual backup functionality for your offline business application. It ensures your critical business data is protected and can be recovered in case of system crashes or data corruption.

## Features

### üîÑ **Automatic Backups**
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours automatically
- **Background Operation**: Runs in a separate thread without affecting app performance
- **Startup Backup**: Creates a backup every time the application starts
- **No User Intervention Required**: Runs silently in the background

### üìÅ **Backup Storage**
- **Location**: Stored alongside your executable file in `database_backups/` folder
- **Portable**: Backups travel with your application when moved to different locations
- **Format**: Standard SQLite database files (.db extension)
- **Retention**: Keeps the last 10 backups automatically (configurable)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Manual Backup Control**
- **Instant Backups**: Create backups immediately with optional descriptions
- **Custom Naming**: Add descriptions to identify important backup points
- **Manual Triggers**: Create backups before important operations

### üîß **Disaster Recovery**

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manual_20250922_150000_inventory_update.db
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

#### Executable Environment (PyInstaller)
```
your_executable_folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BusinessApp.exe           # Your executable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ business_data.db         # Main database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ database_backups/        # Backup folder
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup.log
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ startup_backup.db
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Backup File Format
- **Type**: SQLite database files
- **Compression**: None (preserves data integrity)
- **Compatibility**: Can be opened with any SQLite tool
- **Verification**: Uses SQLite's built-in backup API for integrity

### System Requirements
- **Disk Space**: Each backup is typically the same size as your main database
- **Memory**: Minimal impact during backup creation
- **Performance**: No noticeable impact on application speed

## Configuration Options

The backup system is pre-configured with sensible defaults:

### Current Settings
- **Backup Frequency**: 6 hours
- **Maximum Backups**: 10 files
- **Startup Backup**: Enabled
- **Background Operation**: Enabled

### Customizing Settings

To modify backup behavior, edit `backup_manager.py`:

```python
# Change backup frequency (in hours)
backup_manager.start_automatic_backups(interval_hours=12)  # 12 hours instead of 6

# Change maximum backup retention
backup_manager = DatabaseBackupManager(db_path, max_backups=20)  # Keep 20 backups
```

## Monitoring and Logs
